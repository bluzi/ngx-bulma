# Developer guide: getting your environment set up

1. Make sure you have `node` installed with at least version 8.11.0.
2. Fork the `bluzi/ngx-bulma` repo. 
3. Clone your fork. 
   Recommendation: name your git remotes `upstream` for `bluzi/ngx-bulma`
   and `<your-username>` for your fork.
4. From the root of the project, run `npm install`.
 
To bring up a local server, run `npm run start`. This will automatically watch for changes
and rebuild. The browser should refresh automatically when changes are made.

### Running tests

To run unit tests, run `npm run test`.
To run lint, run `npm run lint`.

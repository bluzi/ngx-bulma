## The goal of NGX-Bulma
Our goal is to build a set of high-quality UI components built with Angular and TypeScript,
following the Bulma Design Spec. These
components will serve as an example of how to write Angular code following best practices.

### What do we mean by "high-quality"?
* Internationalized and accessible so that all users can use them.
* Straightforward APIs that don't confuse developers.
* Behave as expected across a wide variety of use-cases without bugs.
* Behavior is well-tested with both unit and integration tests.
* Customizable within the bounds of Bulma Design specification.
* Performance cost is minimized.
* Code is clean and well-documented to serve as an example for Angular devs.

## Browser and screen reader support
NGX-Bulma supports the most recent two versions of all major browsers:
Chrome (including Android), Firefox, Safari (including iOS), and IE11 / Edge
